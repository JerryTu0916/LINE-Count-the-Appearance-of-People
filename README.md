Just run the Python scripts. Make sure that the input file is in the same folder as the script before doing so.
The DateTest.py is for graphing the amount of message sent per month.
The heart.py is for counting the appearance of those 'heart emoji(s)' and the amount of times they appear.
The time.py must be ran before running sumOfTime.py, and their function is to count the amount of successful video/
'free' phone calls, and the sum of their total time.
